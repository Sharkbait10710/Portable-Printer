#Portable Printer

The goal of this project is to create a robust printer that is lightweight and rigid in structure, capable of sketching images on 8.5 x 11 printer paper with relatively high accuracy by using a pen and resume printing capability, and has user-friendly UI software that can send virtual images to printer in real-time (image is still in progress, but would like to be drawn immediately) or by completion (image is complete and ready to print).

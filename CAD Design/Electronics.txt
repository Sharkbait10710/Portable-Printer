Since there are two stepper motors, two DRV8255 drivers will be needed to control them
Since self-sensing is one of the capabilities of this project, the project will need two tactile sensors
        one being the endstop switch (for leadscrew motion)
        not sure if enstop would be able to detect paper though. Better than using other sensors due to price
            initially thinking of VCSEL (vertical cavity surface emitting laser), like SparkFun VL53L1X, but it
            was too expensive
        maybe use a proxmity sensor for paper sensor
        try infrared diode led IR emission and reciever

        AND https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mOF1JXo1DU TO CREATE OWN PROXIMITY SENSOR*****
    to detect the location of the paper and the pen
A 12V power supply is needed to power the motor drivers and a step down /  6-7 power supply is needed to
    power the ESP32 
Use PCB for circuit board
    I'm gonna try Altium CircuitMaker (software to make Gerber file) and JLCPCB (manufacturer)

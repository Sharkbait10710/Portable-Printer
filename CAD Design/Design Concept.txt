Major Parts

    Chassis
        Consist of NEMA 17 stepper motor, lead screw, and nut carrier that moves pen mount
        houses electronics
        paper passes through Chassis
        *ball bearings to house lead screw
        *rod shaft to support nut carrier
        *use rectangular structure embedded under lead screw

    Pen Mount
        actached to nut carrier and moves as NEMA 17 rotates its shaft
        tightly attached to pen
        uses servo motor to lift and depress pen
        can lift pen easily and quickly
        mounted on wheels for reduction of friction
        use quick-draw (not correct name) mechanism to lift pen during non-drawing time
        sensor to help locate pen

    Roller
        accepts paper and consistent pushes paper under pen mount   
        paper distance inside chassis is consistently and accurately controlled
        controlled using spur gear and stepper motor
        feeds paper into chassism where pen will draw on paper
        should be able to push paper in and pull paper out
        sensor to detect paper

    Paper Dispenser
        straightens paper and minimizes curls in the paper
        should keep paper down as pen is moving back and forth

    electronics
        use PCB board and attach to all motors (stepper and servo), sensor, and microncontroller
        microncontroller is esp32 for internet capability
        12V power supply 
        DRV8255 motor driver
        *need 5-8ish power supply to power esp32

The lead screw cannot have a lead that is too small because the stepper motor must turn faster to make the nut carrier 
move faster. However, doing this requires sending pulses much quicker to the stepper motor, which generates more rapidly
changing currents. This in turn causes the stator windings to create stronger magnetic fields, thus more friction, and less
torque.

An increase in rotational friction due to stronger magnetic fields which are in turn due to high pulse per second (PPS) can
cause the nut mount to vibrate during prints, which would decrease print quality. Therefore, a cap on linear speed should be 
specify.

Since linear speed is equivalent to the rotational speed of the stepper motor times the lead per rotation, a larger lead 
will increase linear speed. Furthermore, lower rotational speeds are required to travel the same distance compared to leads that are 
smaller. However, this would require microstepping for more accurate positioning of the nut carrier, which would decrease the torque
output by about 30%.

Longer lead will significantly lower print time and reduce friction due to stronger magnetic fields (hence increase torque output),
but will decrease gear ratio and overall accuracy. What a short lead can due is increase precision and significantly increase torque
output, but there is a significantly trade off for speed.

So, for quick prints, longer leads are more effective, but for precise prints, short leads are better.
    for high precision, use short leads and use lower speeds.

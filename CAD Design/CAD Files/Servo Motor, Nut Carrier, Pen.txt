The nut carrier will be placed on a linear guide and is attachable by bolts and nuts. This will allow replacement of leads
which will help evaluating leads and determine which lead produces the best quality and print time.

The servo motor will be attached onto the nut carrier via bolts and nuts for easy disassemble and placed on its side
such that the shaft is pointing long at the lead screw axis. 

The servo motor will use a quick return mechanism to lift and lower the pen on the paper. A servo motor is a good choice
to do this because it provides strong output torque to prevent the pen from moving up or down, thus reducing vibrations
and improving print quality. 

The pen will be mounted on a pen mount that will securely hold the pen and prevent the pen from slipping. A pen 
coupling would be needed to do this and should be able to tighten and untighten for easy disassemble. The pen mount will
be able to move up and down and its position will be controlled via the quick return mechanism. The pen mount shouldn't 
be too heavy and should not cause the pen to lean.

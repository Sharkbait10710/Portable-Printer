1) Structural rigid and relatively lightweight for easy transportation
    wires are simple and easy to store
    electronics are well protected and safety concealed to protect users and printer

2) Uses a pen to draw on printer paper 
    printer must be minimum 8.5 x 11 in to accomodate printer paper
    sketched drawing should be relatively accurate to user's sketched
    consistent prints
    print speed should be reasonable
    if power is lost, printer can resume printing

3) Incorporates a user-friendly UI that can accept user drawings and prints them via Portable printer
    UI should be IOS friendly 
    should be able to print real-time(image is still in progress, but would like to be drawn immediately) and by completion (image is complete and ready to print)

Possible improvements:
    as cheap as possible with maximum quality
    as fast as possible without compromising sketch quality or damage to parts
    as compact as possible

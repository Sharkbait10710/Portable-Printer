    {
        Researched GUI design and how to use CSS. Found Bootstrap and plan to implement it.
        Learned about Ultralight which "enables you to build your application's GUI with web pages and C/C++"

        Learned about linear guide from https://youtu.be/XZXadrjIm_4 and discovered cad file at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2847294

        Instead of using shafts for linear bearings, using linear guide is better since it saves more space. The thingiverse link would
        serve as a guide. Need balls though, this link looks good https://www.amazon.com/500Pcs-Assorted-Loose-Bicycle-Bearing/dp/B085T3BT92/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=bearing+balls&qid=1627441064&sr=8-3

        Learned how stepper motors work from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWMai3oirnM "Stepper Motor - How It Works." 
        Pulses are sent to stepper motor which create varying magnetic fields to turn a permanent magnet (or something similar) to in order to change its rotational position.
    }

2021-07-28 06:37:45
    {
        Learned even more about stepper motor. A single digital pulse moves a single step by energizing coil (I think running current briefly generates a magnetic field in 
        one coil, but when current begins to stop a magnetic field in the opposite direction is generated). Microstepping is also possible.

2021-07-28 06:44:43
    {
        I learned more about stepper motors and learned that there are 2 coils inside a stepper motor and each coil is energized alternatively in order to generate
        magnetic fields in the same direction to rotate the shaft.

        I worked on the lead screw design. I will wait for the paper feed roller design after I recieve the rollers today. I'm not completely sure how the roller will
        effective feed paper without causing curlings. I'm also not sure how to prevent the paper from curling in general as it enters the chassis. My questions are 
        "Does the pen cause the paper to curl?" "Will the paper need to be fed into a narrow slit to hold the paper down and will the slit cause the paper to curl?"

        Worked on the Servo Motor, Nut Carrier, and Pen design.

2021-07-28 10:38:52
    {
        Have a much better idea as to what to do. Know what sensors to use to calibrate roller and pen. Know where to buy sensor. Have a good idea on what electrical
        components to use. I think now is a good time to start designing

        Worked on linear guide. Got into some trouble.
        Issues were: balls are same size as holes, but for some reason, there is interference, even for cylinder holes (which should be an obvious fit)
                        difficulty assembling all the parts. Not sure why there are interference when I tried to fit the 15 balls between the carrier / cap 
                        and rail
        Slightly larger holes might be good because lubrication

        Linear Guide assembly is complete, but assembling 6-32 screws and nuts is too difficult for me right now. Going to start working on the lead screw and nut carrier.
    }

    {
        Learned how to draw threads. Just finished lead screw.

    {
        Worked on nut carrier (servo mount), but seems like the linear guide is a bit big. Could be improved. Check nut holes on linear guide carrier. Perhaps walls should be 
        thickened.

        Continued to develop the servo mount on the nut carrier, but will attempt to print to evaluate quality

        Tried setting up Ultralight, but not working. Probably better to use something different to develop UI

    {
        Printed out rail, pen mount, and linear guide. Quality of all are not up to standard. Rough surfaces for those rail (by Longer) and parts printed on Labist (pen mount)
        have very bad tolerance. This implies that labist produces worst quality parts than Longer and adjustments must be made.

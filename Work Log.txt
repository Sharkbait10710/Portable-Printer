        Created Design folder, which would house the SW files, and currently contains the general design idea text file

        Continued working on Design Concept. Have good idea of CAD design now

        Researched GUI design and how to use CSS. Found Bootstrap and plan to implement it.
        Learned about Ultralight which "enables you to build your application's GUI with web pages and C/C++"

        Instead of using shafts for linear bearings, using linear guide is better since it saves more space. The thingiverse link would
        serve as a guide. Need balls though, this link looks good https://www.amazon.com/500Pcs-Assorted-Loose-Bicycle-Bearing/dp/B085T3BT92/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=bearing+balls&qid=1627441064&sr=8-3

        Learned how stepper motors work from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWMai3oirnM "Stepper Motor - How It Works." 
        Pulses are sent to stepper motor which create varying magnetic fields to turn a permanent magnet (or something similar) to in order to change its rotational position.

    {
        Learned even more about stepper motor. A single digital pulse moves a single step by energizing coil (I think running current briefly generates a magnetic field in 
        one coil, but when current begins to stop a magnetic field in the opposite direction is generated). Microstepping is also possible.

    {
        I learned more about stepper motors and learned that there are 2 coils inside a stepper motor and each coil is energized alternatively in order to generate
        magnetic fields in the same direction to rotate the shaft.

        I worked on the lead screw design. I will wait for the paper feed roller design after I recieve the rollers today. I'm not completely sure how the roller will
        effective feed paper without causing curlings. I'm also not sure how to prevent the paper from curling in general as it enters the chassis. My questions are 
        "Does the pen cause the paper to curl?" "Will the paper need to be fed into a narrow slit to hold the paper down and will the slit cause the paper to curl?"

        Instead of using shafts for linear bearings, using linear guide is better since it saves more space. The thingiverse link would
        serve as a guide. Need balls though, this link looks good https://www.amazon.com/500Pcs-Assorted-Loose-Bicycle-Bearing/dp/B085T3BT92/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=bearing+balls&qid=1627441064&sr=8-3
